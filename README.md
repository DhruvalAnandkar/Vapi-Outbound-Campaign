Project Overview
This Node.js application orchestrates an outbound call campaign using the Vapi API. It reads a list of businesses from a JSON file, schedules calls to them with a specified delay, and uses a pre-defined AI assistant to deliver a message about after-hours lead capture.

The project includes:

An Express.js server to handle API requests.

Integration with the Vapi API for scheduling outbound calls.

A configurable list of target businesses.

Logic for A/B testing different AI assistant scripts.

Features
Automated Outbound Calling: Schedules calls to a list of phone numbers.

Configurable Call Timing: Allows setting delays between calls.

A/B Testing: Supports using multiple Vapi AI assistants/scripts for comparison.

Dynamic Business List: Reads target businesses from a businessList.json file.

Vapi Integration: Leverages Vapi's robust platform for AI voice interaction.

Setup Instructions (Local)
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

A Vapi Account with an API Key, a configured Phone Number ID, and at least two Assistant IDs (for A/B testing).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DhruvalAnandkar/Vapi-Outbound-Campaign.git
cd Vapi-Outbound-Campaign

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configuration
Create a .env file:
In the root of your project directory, create a file named .env. This file will store your sensitive API keys and other configurations.

VAPI_API_KEY="YOUR_VAPI_API_KEY"
PHONE_NUMBER_ID="YOUR_VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID"
ASSISTANT_ID1="YOUR_FIRST_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID" # e.g., for the "Riley" persona
ASSISTANT_ID2="YOUR_SECOND_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID" # e.g., for the "Zoe" persona

Important: Do NOT commit your .env file to version control (it's already included in .gitignore).

Prepare businessList.json:
Ensure you have a businessList.json file in the root of your project. This file should contain an array of objects, each representing a business to call. Example structure:

[
  {
    "name": "Stonecreek Dental Care",
    "number": "+14192810760"
  },
  {
    "name": "Ashland Dental Arts",
    "number": "+14194960132"
  }
  // ... more businesses
]

Ensure phone numbers are in E.164 format (e.g., +1XXXXXXXXXX).

Running the Application (Local)
Start the server:

npm start

You should see output similar to:
ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:3000
To start campaign, visit http://localhost:3000/api/start-campaign in your browser.

Trigger the campaign:
Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/api/start-campaign

The server will then begin scheduling calls with Vapi, and you will see logs in your terminal confirming each scheduled call.

Deployment to Render
This application is designed to be easily deployed to a platform like Render for continuous operation.

GitHub Repository: Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository. The package.json file must be in the root of the repository.

Render Web Service: Create a new Web Service on Render.com and connect it to your GitHub repository.

Root Directory: In Render's service settings, ensure the "Root Directory" is set to vapi-test-project (or the name of your main project folder if it's not in the root of your repo).

Environment Variables: Add all your VAPI_API_KEY, PHONE_NUMBER_ID, ASSISTANT_ID1, and ASSISTANT_ID2 as environment variables in Render's dashboard.

Build & Start Commands: Render will automatically detect npm install for the build command and node index.js (from your start script in package.json) for the start command.

Trigger Live Campaign: Once deployed and live, trigger the campaign by visiting your Render service's public URL followed by /api/start-campaign (e.g., https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/start-campaign).
